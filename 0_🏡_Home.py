    We live in an age of rampant disinformation, both deliberate and accidental. The proliferation of
    fake news has been accelerated in recent years through social media channels like Facebook, What's App,
    Reddit, and others. Whether deliberate or accidental, misinformation drives powerful social and psychological
    forces that shape how we behave in our society.

    High quality, verfied information is the bedrock of a healthy public so that individuals can make
    informed decisions about their own lives. Spotting fake news, however, can be a particularly tricky task.
    Even a keen-eyed individual is not immune to the subtleties of unverified information. As a light example,
    take the following news headline:

st.warning("\"CAT LOVERS CAN TRY CAT FOOD INSPIRED DISHES AT FANCY FEAST'S ITALIAN POP-UP\"")

    There's nothing that you can exactly *point to* that's wrong with this headline, other than it feels absurd.
    You may even be surprised to find that it's a [real headline](https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/31/business/fancy-feast-cat-food-restaurant-trnd/index.html).
    Often time, the news is happening around is so fast and is spread widely online in so many different
    formats that our attention might be so exhausted that we take what we see as fact.

    If we train a machine learning model on as many examples of fake and real news articles as possible, then
    we can deploy this tool to filter out fake content on information platforms before they proliferate enough to
    substantially influence public opinion.

    To learn more about how this works under the hood, keep reading this article. First, however, feel free to play
    around with our fake news detection tool by plugging in any website to get a prediction for what our AI thinks of
    that article.

    Have you ever wondered how websites like [google.com](https://www.google.com) and [nytimes.com](https://www.nytimes.com) work under the hood?
    Using the internet every day, it is easy to forget how magical even the most mundane web browsing experiences
    are. 

    The answer is HTML which stands for Hyper Text Markup Language that describes the structure of Web pages
    in elemental block form. To play around with HTML, open up this [interactive environment](https://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_default)
    to play around with writing your own HTML code! Additionally, if you go to any site, if you right click on the page, you'll be able to
    'View Source' or 'View Selection' to see the HTML source code for that page.

    Now that we know how to extract the core information that encodes any given news site, we can take the URL of a news site
    along with its HTML source code to train our machine learning model on how to differentiate between real and fake news.
